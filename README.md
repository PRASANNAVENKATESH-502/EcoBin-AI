EcoBin-AI

EcoBin-AI is an innovative AI-powered waste management system that automates the process of sorting and classifying waste. By integrating advanced image recognition, robotic arms, and edge computing, the project aims to promote sustainability and improve waste collection efficiency.

🌟 Features

Automated Waste Classification: Uses AI/ML models to classify waste into categories like metal, plastic, glass, paper, and more.
Robotic Sorting: A robotic arm segregates waste into designated compartments.
Smart Notifications: Real-time updates on bin levels and air quality through an integrated app.
Eco-Friendly Design: Solar-powered mobility and reduced waste collection costs.

💡 How It Works

Waste is detected and captured using proximity sensors and a camera module.
The AI model processes the image and classifies the waste.
A robotic arm sorts the waste into the appropriate compartment.
Notifications are sent to the municipal team when bins are full.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, servo motors, proximity sensors, robotic arm, and camera module.
Software: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (AI models), and IoT integration.
App: Real-time tracking and notifications.

🚀 Goals

Promote eco-friendly waste management solutions.
Enhance automation in residential and industrial waste systems.
Incorporate electronic waste classification in future versions.
